            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <h5>While Ainz is a cautious and stingy person, he will always try to plan ahead and control details beforehand in order to avoid any haphazard actions that can endanger Nazarick's existence. This means going so far as lying to the inhabitants in the New World that he can't use one of his Super-tier spells for years to come after using it once. Since being transferred to the New World and becoming an actual undead being, Ainz has felt himself becoming very cold and calculating while his emotions are repressed. He was not the least bit afraid of lying to or provoking his combatants, using each and every trick he can think of to overcome the odds. He takes satisfaction from experimenting with his powers by measuring the extent of it to the point where he heartlessly brainwashes and kills people. Everything Ainz aims to do was to better himself, rack up accomplishments, and master new ways to use his magic and stats in the New World.</h5>

                <p><h5>As an Overlord, Ainz Ooal Gown is a skeleton with a robe and staff. He is a lich, an undead creature with a skeletal body, and his face is a bare skull. He wears a set of elaborate robes and carries a staff. His appearance is that of a stereotypical dark wizard. He is a tall, skeletal figure who is dressed in a black robe decorated with gold trimmings. He has a pair of red points of light in the eye sockets of his skull, which are not actually eyes. His voice is described as being hollow and echoing, as if it is coming from an empty space.</h5> </p>
